# DiabetesDataAnalysis
The primary purpose of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Diabetes dataset,which includes parameters like Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure,SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigree, Age, and Outcome, is to comprehensively investigate and understand the data.This involves uncovering patterns, distributions,and relationships within the dataset,as well as detecting and addressing data quality issues such as missing values and outliers.EDA will enable us to gain insights into the factors that may influence the"Outcome"variable,which represents the presence or absence of diabetes.Additionally,EDA can aid in hypothesis generation,variable selection for predictive modeling, and ensuring that the dataset is appropriately prepared for subsequent analyses.Overall,EDA is a critical step in uncovering valuable insights and preparing the data for predictive modeling or further research in the context of diabetes.
